In sports quant trading, a backtester is a system used to evaluate trading strategies by simulating their performance on historical data. The key components of a backtester typically include:

Data Handler: Manages historical and/or real-time market data (e.g., odds, scores, player stats, game events). It ensures data is clean, properly formatted, and accessible for the backtester.
Strategy Module: Defines the trading logic or algorithm, specifying when to place bets or trades based on predefined rules (e.g., arbitrage, value betting, or statistical models).
Execution Simulator: Mimics the execution of trades or bets, accounting for factors like latency, slippage, and bookmaker rules (e.g., minimum/maximum bet sizes, odds changes).
Portfolio Manager: Tracks the performance of the strategy, including capital allocation, profit/loss (P&L), and risk metrics (e.g., drawdowns, Sharpe ratio).
Risk Management Module: Implements constraints like position sizing, stop-loss limits, or exposure caps to mitigate potential losses.
Performance Evaluator: Analyzes the results of the backtest, generating metrics such as win rate, ROI, volatility, and statistical significance of the strategyâ€™s edge.
Event Handler: Coordinates the interaction between components, ensuring the backtester processes data, triggers trades, and updates the portfolio in a time-accurate sequence.
Logging and Reporting: Records detailed logs of trades, decisions, and outcomes for debugging and analysis, often visualized through charts or summary reports.
